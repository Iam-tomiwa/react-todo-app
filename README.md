## Hi There! 👋

This is my first react app and it was thrilling building it as it a great learning curve.

**[Here](https://www.frontendmentor.io)** is the live link to my todo app challenge (created with react and react-beautiful-dnd for the drag and drop functionality) I found on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io).

> [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges allow you to improve your skills in a real-life workflow.

Star⭐ the repo if you like what you see😉.

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this todo app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
